> _Rust bindings to the [Dart ffi api](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop)_

## Prerequisites üîß

You will need the following tools available on your system:

- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) version 2.12 or higher
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) version 1.51 or higher
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Unix/Linux üêß

No additional requirements :)

### MacOS üçé

No additional requirements :)

### Windows ü™ü

On Windows platforms, dynamic libraries are linked _against_ the executable, not _into_ the executable as is the case o
Unix platforms.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important ‚ö†Ô∏è

This means that (on Windows) you will **_Need_** to have the Dart SDK installed and available on your system path to
be able to compile Dart-sys.

## Installing üì¶

Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:

```bash
cargo add dart-sys
```

Or add the following line to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
dart-sys = "4.1.0"
```

## Usage üíª

### Examples üìö

An extremely straightforward example of using `dart-sys` would be like such:

```rust
use dart_sys::{Dart_Handle, Dart_NewIntegerFromI64};

#[no_mangle]
/// Adds two integers together.
pub extern "C" fn dart_sys_example_extension_sum(
    a: Dart_Handle,
    b: Dart_Handle,
) -> Dart_Handle {
    let a = unsafe { Dart_NewIntegerFromI64(a) };
    let b = unsafe { Dart_NewIntegerFromI64(b) };
    a + b
}

#[no_mangle]
/// Multiplies two integers together.
pub extern "C" fn dart_sys_example_extension_product(
    a: Dart_Handle,
    b: Dart_Handle,
) -> Dart_Handle {
    let a = unsafe { Dart_NewIntegerFromI64(a) };
    let b = unsafe { Dart_NewIntegerFromI64(b) };
    a * b
}
```

```dart
import 'dart:ffi';

// open and link to the native library
final DynamicLibrary nativeLib = DynamicLibrary.open('libdart_sys_example_extension.so');

// lookup the sum function in the native library
final int Function(int, int) sum = nativeLib
    .lookup<NativeFunction<Int32 Function(Int32, Int32)>>('dart_sys_example_extension_sum')
    .asFunction();

// lookup the product function in the native library
final int Function(int, int) product = nativeLib
    .lookup<NativeFunction<Int32 Function(Int32, Int32)>>('dart_sys_example_extension_product')
    .asFunction();

void main() {
    print(sum(1, 2)); // 3
    print(product(1, 2)); // 2
}
```

While this example is certainly possible, you are not likely to ever use Dart-sys for this purpose.
See the [examples](examples/) directory for more in-depth
examples of how to use Dart-sys. All examples are tested using GitHub Actions and documented verbosely.

## Built With üõ†Ô∏è

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - A systems programming language that runs
 blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - A client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform.
- [Dart Native Extensions](https://dart.dev/server/c-interop-native-extensions) - A mechanism
 for writing native code in C/C++ and calling it from Dart.
- [bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen) - A Rust library for generating
 bindings to C and C++ APIs.
